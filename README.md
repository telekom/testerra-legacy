## About

This repository hosts legacy [Testerra Framework](https://github.com/telekom/testerra) components that are no longer being actively maintained.

You can still use these modules, but we do not support them anymore. The module could work with the latest Testerra version but there is no guarantee.

## Legacy Testerra modules

| Module            | Latest version | Old documentation     | Use instead           |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| BMP               | 1.3            | [Testerra BMP module] | [Testerra BUP module] |

[Testerra BMP module]: https://docs.testerra.io/testerra/1.3/index.html#_browser_mob_proxy_deprecated
[Testerra BUP module]: https://docs.testerra.io/testerra/stable/index.html#_browserup_proxy
